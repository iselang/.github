# ISE (Interface Style Enliner)

ISE (/e/si/) is a cutting-edge programming language designed to simplify software development, providing faster, more intuitive ways to build modern applications. Unlike traditional frameworks, ISE isn't a framework—it's a self-contained language built to be flexible, fast, and easy to integrate.

## What is ISE
ISE is an open-source programming language crafted for developers who value simplicity, speed, and flexibility. With ISE, you can quickly create responsive applications for Android and Linux, with upcoming support for Windows and Apple platforms. It’s not a framework—just a powerful, lightweight tool for building the future of software.

## What ISE isn’t
ISE is not a framework  
ISE does not rely on SDKs  
ISE isn’t a library that you need to install from third-party services  
ISE doesn’t hide its code behind unnecessary abstraction layers  

## What is ISE For
ISE is made for developers who  
Want to build apps quickly with minimal setup  
Prefer the simplicity of native language features  
Focus on building clean, high-performance applications that work across multiple platforms  
Need to deal with app structure, UI, database management, routing, and hardware support in a single, unified language  

## Current Version 1.8  
ISE 1.8 introduces a slew of powerful new features  
- SenUI A modern UI framework for responsive and dynamic applications  
- AutoUI Automatically optimizes UI for better performance  
- MyaDB Lightweight, offline-first database integration  
- Direct Compilation Run apps seamlessly across supported platforms (Linux & Android)  
- Preloading Improves page load times and reduces layout shifts  
- Auto Accessibility & Auto SEO Makes your app more inclusive and discoverable by default  
- Native Hardware Support Direct APIs for accessing device sensors, cameras, and more  
- Increased support for better hardware integration and real-time syncing  

## How to Start
1. Clone the repository or include the ISE CDN in your project  
2. Start coding with ISE’s intuitive syntax and structure  
3. Use ise.get.PLATFORM() to deploy to the right platform (Linux, Android, etc.)  
4. Use the native APIs, like AutoUI, SenUI, and MyaDB, to simplify your workflow  
5. Enjoy a smooth, intuitive development experience without excessive setup or dependencies  

## Used For
- Building responsive, cross-platform mobile applications  
- Creating lightweight web apps with efficient dynamic content  
- Automating UI design and layout with AutoUI  
- Handling real-time data with MyaDB  
- Seamlessly integrating with hardware devices using native APIs  

## When is it Back
ISE is already back and running in production with fully supported versions for Linux and Android. Full support for Windows and Apple is temporarily paused, but expect better integration soon.

## Native Thingy
ISE gives you the best of native development, providing direct access to hardware APIs for sensors, cameras, and more. Its native approach ensures that your apps perform with minimal overhead, meaning they run faster and more efficiently on real devices.

## Background Languages
ISE is built using the following background languages  
- C Language For core functionality, system-level performance, and low-level optimization  
- JavaScript For app logic, structure, styling, and HTML rendering  
JavaScript is responsible for handling all aspects of the app including logic, structure, styling, and rendering HTML and CSS, making it the main language for controlling app behavior and appearance.

## Who Made It
ISE was developed by the ISE team under Team Sharebyte Corporation, a brand agency based in the Philippines. We are committed to advancing technology, systems, and brand development, with a strong focus on artificial intelligence as well.

## Android Support
ISE Android support is powered by **Median.co**, ensuring smooth and optimized performance for Android devices.
